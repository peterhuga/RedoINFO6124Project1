Redo INFO6124 Project1 with new skills and knowledge

After I was learn Mobile App Developemnt program at the college for 2 month, I did an app for the project 1 of course INFO6124 Android App Development. The app is used by students in this program to log the grades they get for all the labs, projects and exams in every of the 6 courses. They are also able to see the summary of every course that shows what their current grade is in percent for this particular course. 
In the fifth month into learning, I redid the project with some new skills and knowledges acquired during the past three months.
